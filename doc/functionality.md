# Flashing Lights Image Stack Processing Software

### Functionality

1. Identifies Regions of Interest based on relative pixel brightness
2. Tracks ROI throughout the image stack
3. Uses information from tracked ROI to give fluorescence intensity vs. time profiles
4. Accumulates frequency of fluorescence events as a heat map
5. Separately accumulates fluorescence intensity of events as a heat map
